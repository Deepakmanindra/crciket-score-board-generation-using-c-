India win by 11 runs on the back of a very strong finish to their innings and an excellent performance in the field. Australia had a good start to the chase but struggled badly after Finch departed. Decent story out of the match with Chahal, who came in as a concussion sub for Jadeja, playing a key role with the ball (after Jadeja had done with the bat).

Sugumar: "That catch by Samson changed everything tonight. Way to go young indians!!!!"

Mukunth: "So, Australia got a fair bit of an idea on the X-factor player rule before the BBL" Ha, almost

Deepak Sahu: "India's new allrounder Jadechal won us the game.. what an all-round performance"

Man of the Match is Chahal! "A great feeling, no pressure for me when we were batting then I got to know I was going to play. Ten to 15 minutes before I got to know I would play. I learnt from my ODI mistake where I bowled with some flight. In the first innings it was a bit hard to score against their spinners...and I bowled according to my plans."

Aaron Finch On his injury:"Bit of a hip or glute, we'll wait and see, it progressively got worse throughout the game."

On Chahal: "They were let using know their doctor had ruled Jadeja out with concussion and you aren't challenging a medical expert in that regard. We probably leaked a few too many runs at the end and then in the middle phase struggled to heat boundaries."

Virat Kohli "Jaddu got a knock on the side of a head and was a bit dizzy and still is. Concussion replacements are a strange thing, today it worked for us maybe another time he wouldn't have found a like-for-like. He came in and bowled really well. The pitch offered him enough. We showed character to fight back...I thought they had a great start and they were cruising to be honest. That's how T20 goes, we put enough pressure on them, but you need a bit of luck."

I'll wrap things up for tonight. Excellent performance from India. From Gnasher and Varun it's goodbye and see you in a couple of days

Samson you stunner! Oh boy! We saw a good one from Pandya earlier but this was, by some degree, a harder one. It's flat, it's dipping, it's absolutely laced across the line. Samson runs in from deep midwicket, staying low at every point and then dives to pick it up low and in front of himself. That took so much hurried movement that he absolutely had to nail the follow through as well to hold on - and he does that with the most graceful tumble. Superb. A slog across the line that Smith got good connection on

James: "@ Achal: I agree which is why it is fair to take Jadeja off as a concussion sub. However, given Jadeja's injury, it's hard to argue that Chahal would have played the same "likely role" as Jadeja in the match. Hell, even without Jadeja's injury, they are still very different bowlers. Smells fishy to me." --- The laws for likeness are built more around the role the player would have played. In this case, would they both have bowled four overs? That was the question the referee had to answer. But you can't blame Australia for protesting this because of the hamstring injury.

Shami to Short, 1 run
Good length at the stumps, backs away and punches to mid-off's right

Ashish: "Per the rules it makes perfect sense that chahal comes on as Jaddu would have bowled his 4 overs quota. But the question remains, was it an external injury or actually a concussion! Fine line which can never be explained I guess." --- And to reiterate, the referee had the final say in it. Boon has seen merit in the replacement choice (like-for-like) after being convinced Jadeja is concussed.

Oh cleeean. Full and into the pads. Finch hangs right back in the crease, and this is all hands from there. The perfect closing of the wrists and the bat face and he lifts the over deep square

Achal: "Smith continued to bat on after getting struck in the last Ashes as well, didn't he? Concussions can also take hours to show up..."

Here is the law regarding concussion subs:


"The ICC Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Concussion Replacement Request if the replacement is a like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his team for the remainder of the match.

"In assessing whether the nominated Concussion Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, the ICC Match Referee should consider the likely role the concussed player would have played during the remainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Concussion Replacement."

Sundar to Short, no run
Short of a length and slides it into the body from around the wicket. Cops that in the mid-riff as he gets back for the pull

Ashish: "QQ here:- There was no concussion test done on Jaddu after the bouncer hit him. Moreover he was having hamstring issues and that was evident in last couple overs. And now a concussion sub. I think this is not fair to Australia and rightly Langer was having a debate with Match referee during the interval."

Rian : "Concussion sub?? That's blatant manipulation of the rules and a very dangerous road to go down. If they were worried he was concussed, why didn't a physio check on him when he was hit on the helmet?" ---- this seemed to be Langer's argument with referee David Boon - who made the decision that Chahal was a suitable replacement
